# FLC-Breakout
Breakout-inspired game to be made by the FLC++ Programming Club, written in python


Uses Python 3, since there's no reason not to.

Will probably depend on PySDL2 and Pygame, but is subject to change.


INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES:

(Note: These instructions are for windows)

1. Install Python 3 on your computer (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe)
2. Add python to your path (it should be an option during install, but there's a guide here: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/)

3. Open the command line (type "cmd" without quotes into your windows search if you're unsure how)
4. Type the following commands into the command line:

pip install pysdl2

pip install pygame
